========================================================

Roadmap
=======

Before going further you should notice that this story is planned following these steps , and you can feel free to go at a certain part which interests you .

1- Purpose of devflix project

2- Highlight on partners

3- Interests of the project

4- Personal focus

5- Technical assets

6- Results & Screenshots

Purpose of the project
======================

The problem is a simple remark : Streaming services are not free, maybe for commercial purposes or other stuff but the fact is "They are expensive for people with less money". So the question remaining was how to give free access of those libraries to people ?


Interest of the project
=======================

The interest of this project is to let people with geeky tastes to entertain theirselves using our application. It takes more sense since common streaming applications don't have a particular category for geeks.

Personal focus
==============

I personally focused on working about the backend part of the application :

Doing the server and implementing the routes that should be connected to the frontend .

Justification about framework choice
------------------------------------

Choosing the framework to use for this project has been a real struggle. In fact, we have been confronted with a comparison between Django REST framework and Flask framework.

The first one is a great and powerful tool given to developers in order to create API that communicate with their user interfaces while the second is a small micro framework more simple and easier to take in hand to develop complete web applications or API.

We definitely have choosen Flask because it is the main framework we use in the holberton curriculum.
